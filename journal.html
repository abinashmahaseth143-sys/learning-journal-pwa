        <h2>Week 2 – Frontend Fundamentals</h2>
        <p><strong>1. How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
        When building the Learning Journal website I went with a mobile-first approach, laying the foundation with HTML and CSS, and then carefully rearranging the layout as I worked down to the smallest screen sizes, so that the content is perfectly clear and well-organised. </p>

        <p><strong>2. What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
        Well-known CSS media queries allowed me to really bring the site to life for larger screens like tablets and desktops. Just this week, I've started to delve into the world of Flexbox and how it can be used to sort out my navigation bar and content sections in seconds. And, by using Flexbox, I’ve found that creating a clean, flexible design is a whole lot simpler than using complicated positioning and floating techniques.</p>

        <p><strong>3. What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
        The hardest part for me was getting to grips with CSS media queries and how to easily change positioning between columns or rows based on width of the screens. Initially, it was overwhelming working with so many breakpoints and testing the design on multiple screens. But since I was testing and previewing my website with the Live Server extension in VS Code, I had a better dressed on responsive design now.

Overall, the week was fantastic at reinforcing my knowledge in how to structure my HTML, styling with CSS and the need to design first on mobile. I'm now feeling more confident creating the responsive site that is phenomenal on all devices.</p>

  <h2>Week 3 – JavaScript & DOM Manipulation</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why?</strong><br>
  I chose to use querySelector() for class-based selections like.hero, as it is more flexible, while unique elements like the nav placeholder used getElementById() because of speed.
I also chose some journal entries for collapsible behavior via querySelectorAll().</p>
  <p><strong>2. What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</strong><br>
  The most difficult part about lin<king your javascript with html was to ensure JavaScript ran after the DOM loaded, to avoid null issues.Was able to resolve an issue using DOMContentLoaded and debugging ID/class mismatches in DevTools.</p>
  <p><strong>3. How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</strong><br>
  Using DOMContentLoaded and debugging ID/Class mismatches in DevTools, I fixed the issue. I tried using Chrome Console for error messages and console.log() and Live Server for instant reloads. I looked into DOM changes in Elements tab and used DevTools breakpoints for debugging.</p>

  <h2>Week 4 Introduction to API</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Which APIs did you use, and why?</strong><br> 
    I utilized the Local Storage API to keep track of theme preferences, the Notification API to notify users when they save a journal entry, and the Facebook API to share my page. I picked these tools because they really enhance the user experience, making my website feel more interactive and personal.</p>
<p><strong>2. How did you integrate each API with the DOM?</strong><br> 
    I used JavaScript event listeners (addEventListener) to handle button clicks and used DOM methods like getElementById to select elements. The APIs were called in response to these user actions, dynamically changing the page content and behavior. </p>
    <p><strong>3. What challenges did you face?</strong><br>
   The toughest challenge I encountered was figuring out how to store data so it would stick around and making sure it loaded properly after a refresh. Testing the Notification API also required allowing permissions in the browser.</p>
    <p><strong>4. How do these APIs improve your PWA? </strong><br>
   They make my site more interactive, user-friendly, and personalized. The Storage API remembers user choices, the Notification API improves feedback, and the Third-Party API connects my site to social media..</p>
